# HUMAN RESOURCES ANALYTICS
Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?

# PROJECT FOR THE COURSE OF DATA MINING

## THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT IS COMPOSED AS:

### Data Understanding
   - Data semantics
   - Distribution of the variables and statistics
   - Assessing data quality (missing values, outliers)
   - Variables transformations
   - Pairwise correlations and eventual elimination of redundant variables

### Clustering
   * Clustering Analysis by K-means:
      - Choice of attributes and distance function
      - Identification of the best value of k
      - Characterization of the obtained clusters by using both analysis of the k centroids and comparison of the distribution of variables within the clusters and that in the whole dataset
   * Analysis by density-based clustering
      - Choice of attributes and distance function
      - Study of the clustering parameters
      - Characterization and interpretation of the obtained clusters 
   * Analysis by hierarchical clustering
      - Choice of attributes and distance function 
      - Show and discuss different dendograms using different algorithms
   * Final evaluation of the best clustering approach and comparison of the clustering obtained


### Association Rules Mining
  * Frequent patterns extraction with different values of support and different types (i.e. frequent, close, maximal)
  * Discussion of the most interesting frequent patterns and analyze how changes the number of patterns w.r.t. the min_sup parameter
  * Association rules extraction with different values of confidence
  * Discussion of the most interesting rules and analyze how changes the number of rules w.r.t. the min_conf parameter, histogram of rules' confidence and lift
  * Use the most meaningful rules to replace missing values and evaluate the accuracy
  * Use the most meaningful rules to predict the target variable and evaluate the accuracy


### Classification
   * Learning of different decision trees/classification algorithms with different parameters and gain formulas with the object of maximizing the performances
   * Decision trees interpretation
   * Decision trees validation with test and training set
   * Discussion of the best prediction model
